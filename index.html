        <p class="lead">
                I am a fourth-year PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Basel, specializing in public economics. 
                My research explores various aspects of taxation and economic behavior, using both empirical and theoretical approaches.
                In my current projects, I investigate tax avoidance strategies of the super-rich, tax-induced migration and local tax rate competition.
        </p>

        <p class="lead">
                Before starting my PhD, I built experience in empirical research as a research assistant at BAK Economics, 
                where I developed strong skills in economic and statistical analysis, as well as programming.
        </p>

                Besides my academic career, some peers see me as a PhD Coach, supporting them in the early and later stages of their PhD, 
                particularly in decision-making. Since every PhD journey is unique and often feels like a rollercoaster, I strongly believe that 
                being open about mental health is essential for success, both in a PhD program and in life in general. 
                So if youâ€™re struggling, you know who to call :)
