On 2022, July the 27th I presented at the <a href="https://eusar.de/">14th EUSAR Conference</a> our paper entitled "Self-supervised training strategies for SAR image despeckling with deep neural networks". You can access the <a href="https://hal.telecom-paris.fr/hal-03589245v2/document">preprint</a> and to my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k0noE2djhe5ohfIThQW8Dx75SdNz1xM0/view?usp=sharing">slides</a>. The article has been awarded the Best Student Paper Award (2nd place).

With the team of engineers of <a href="https://www.hi-paris.fr/">Hi! Paris</a> we just released a python package called <a href="https://github.com/hi-paris/deepdespeckling">deepdespeckling</a> on <a href="https://pypi.org/project/deepdespeckling/">Pypi</a>. It currently implements <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.13148.pdf">MERLIN<a/> for TerraSAR-X Stripmap and HighRes SpotLight data. The package will be constantly updated. Hopefully more news will follow soon!
